# Prediction of Agricultural N2O Emissions

This project focuses on predicting agricultural nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Analyze agricultural data related to N2O emissions
- Preprocess and prepare the data for machine learning
- Implement and compare various regression models
- Predict N2O emissions based on available features

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset containing various agricultural and environmental features that influence N2O emissions.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature scaling and normalization

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Visualizing data distributions
   - Analyzing correlations between features

3. **Model Implementation**:
   The project implements and compares the following regression models:
   - Linear Regression
   - Random Forest Regressor
   - Gradient Boosting Regressor
   - XGBoost Regressor

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Using appropriate metrics to assess model performance

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need Python and the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- xgboost

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `Prediction_of_Agricultural_N2O_Emissions.ipynb`

## Results

The project compares the performance of different regression models in predicting N2O emissions. Detailed results and visualizations can be found in the Jupyter Notebook.
